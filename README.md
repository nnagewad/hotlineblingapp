# _HOTLINE BLING APP_

## Notes:

- This project uses the [Instagram API](https://www.instagram.com/developer/) to obtain images with the hashtag **#hotlineblingapp**.
- Once the image has been obtained I am capturing the dominant color of the image using [Color Thief](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/color-thief/).
- Once the dominant color has been obtained, it will be sent to the [Philip Hue Lights](http://www2.meethue.com/).
	- **Please note:** This App only works if you have the *Philip Hue Bridge* installed.

### Easter Egg:
- If the user types in **drake**, while on the page, the song *Hotline Bling* will come on along with the lights.
- Once the song is complete, everything should turn off.
